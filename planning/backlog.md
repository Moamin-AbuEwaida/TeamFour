What the visitor/user of the website will get.

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

- **basic functionality**: see a logo, company name, company description, images

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

- **more advanced functions**: navigation, login, registration
  
## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:

- **user story name**: contact info, product gallery
